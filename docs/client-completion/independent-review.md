# Independent Client source review — 2026-11-02

Reviewer: `/root/client_independent_review`, independent from implementation. Initial integration: `/workspace/audit30`, branch `codex/client-completion-20261102`, initial base `a237ae1`.

## Scope and limits

Read AGENTS and scoped Client SQL, server actions and payment API. Focus: exact money, independent approvals, tenant authority, transaction capability binding, acquired Box promises, native execution and refunds. This is a source review, not application certification. The reviewer did not mutate a database or fixtures, independently run SQL, exercise an external PSP, or execute a concurrent revocation race. Commands used were source reads/searches, git revision inspection, SHA-256 calculation and reads of existing test-result summaries. The only reviewer-created file is this report, requested by root.

Implementation-worker and root test results are explicitly attributed below. Earlier failed iterations were retained; they must not be cited as successful final runs. Production, external provider contracts, restoration, real email, storage/scanning and the full visual/mobile/RTL matrix are outside this review's evidence.

## Findings and remediation status

| ID | Concrete cause and impact | Source remediation reviewed | Status / evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | 25030 restricted measurement context/evidence to client_portfolio_read, excluding legitimate Finance/Compliance reviewers. Rewards dashboard and native referral proof verification failed. | 29000 adds scoped Client read OR existing AAL2 rewards review authority; no portfolio mutation expansion. | Addressed in inspected source. Root final 0329: 16 assertions passed in client-followup-sql.log. |
| R2 | Client baseline/ROI/savings/budget actions converted every currency at two decimals: JPY wrong by100, KWD three decimals refused. | Shared exact parseMoneyInput, declared baseline/budget currency; ROI/savings read immutable authorized VERIFIED baseline currency; allocations read exact-org budget currency. | Addressed in inspected source. Existing remediation final unit log: 62 tests passed; action tests executed by implementation worker. |
| R3 | Native benefit command checked authority before financial/wallet/redemption waits, allowing revoked actor to execute after wait. | 30010 rechecks native actor/AAL2/role after locks; 30030 narrows Buyer to own acquired allocation. | Addressed in inspected source; no independently executed two-session race. Root 0330:24 passed. |
| R4 | Envelope assignment accepted Buyer, but global credits_client_access excluded Buyer, making acquired envelope unusable. | 30000 issues private PID/transaction/actor/org/benefit/correlation-bound reserve/release capability and narrow own-Box reader. Global wallet/financial ACL remains unchanged. | Addressed in inspected source; root 0330:24 passed. Exact overlapping Box context tracked separately under R7. |
| R5 | Native execution selected latest approved binding rather than implementation acquired pre-payment; later binding could change purchased effect. | 30010 freezes native binding in pre-PSP Box terms, persists immutable reservation source, executes exact acquired binding. Missing executor blocks before PSP. | Addressed in inspected source; overlap consistency closed R7. Worker lineage0336=16 and pre-PSP0337=3 raw TAP assertions read, zero failures/errors. |
| R6 | AFTER approval trigger immediately issued money under Compliance actor; ensure wallet/award ACL rejected and rolled back valid independent decision. | 32000 immutable execution request + Outbox; actual Finance/AAL2/session execution with post-wait checks; exact approval/source/rule/audience/wallet binding; immutable completion and historical replay. No impersonation or Compliance financial grant. | Addressed in inspected source. Root final R6 v2 native replay:32 assertions passed. |
| R7 | Valid overlapping full-paid cycles could share benefit. Explicit member Box A was replaced by envelope trigger's latest Box B, while native source chose a different acquired context. Valid operation could fail or use inconsistent promise. | 30050 exact command capability selects policy/period/allocation, checks native allocation against acquired source; ambiguous ordinary callers fail explicitly. 31110 preserves original full-paid Box lineage across differential upgrades. | Addressed in source at Box62317c8. Read worker TAP logs:0338 overlap18/18;0336 lineage16/16;0337 missing-executor pre-PSP3/3, all zero not-ok/error lines. Root fresh integrated replay remains required. |
| R8 | Refund-aware economic amount used cumulative quantity through current fact minus all recognized allocations. After a refund, earlier pending library A consumption could be attributed to later ready library B. Example100credits/100minor: consume50+refund50; A consumes50 pending mandate; B consumes50 ready receives100minor; A later receives0. Conservation alone did not protect correct library P&L. | 30070 reconstructs immutable movement chronology into original-credit position slices and sums exact cumulative-floor values per fact, independent of reconciliation order. Original post-allocation funded cap is retained. | Addressed in inspected source at64c38291. Worker actual native0340:24/24; reviewer read final raw TAP (zero not-ok/errors). Covers pending-A/ready-B late reconciliation, exact3333/5001 split, fragmented refunded positions, both book P&L and total conservation. Root final integrated replay remains required. |

## Further concurrency findings from actual recipe

- R9: Root/browser execution reproduced SQLSTATE40P01: one command held a child organization's FK KEY SHARE and waited for the subscription financial lock; the winner held financial and audit sealing requested incompatible organization FOR UPDATE. This was an incident with one persisted operation, not a successful quota race. Shared34000 changes audit organization lock to FOR NO KEY UPDATE, retaining audit-to-audit serialization while allowing child FK KEY SHARE. Narrow UI retries or only patching three entrypoints would not fix the common cause. Addressed in source at86f4231. Read worker two-real-PostgreSQL-session summary: no retry, one persisted site, second54000 quota refusal, no deadlock. Synthetic SQL actor explicitly distinguished from browser/GoTrue evidence.
- R10: Existing audit identity defaults were assigned before BEFORE-trigger lock acquisition. A delayed lower-id event could link to a higher-id event; the next order-by-id lookup then skipped the delayed event. 34000 assigns final identity only after organization/platform serialization, retains original hash payload, and fails closed if identity does not exceed the prior scope head. No old event is rewritten. Addressed in source at86f4231. Worker deterministic delayed-identity test confirms final seal-order IDs, three linear canonical hashes. Reviewer read evidence; did not execute the harness.

## Additional focused review

- Immediate upgrade 31000/31100: no concrete financial, tenant or transaction-capability bypass identified in inspected paths. Quote→accepted preparation→intent→paid event→canonical composite funding remain bound. Original period and exact configured rounding are pinned. Differential upgrade cannot receive full target immediate credit grant. No commercial policy is seeded. This is source-level evidence only, not external capture certification.
- Upgrade 31120 addresses missing durable governance Outbox transitions; zero-rounded options disappear without loosening actual quote validation.
- C10 33000 stores typed canonical commands and exact original arguments/key, links independent approvals, explicitly checks persisted approval states and active policies, revalidates source/CAS and live requester authority, and records completion only for real canonical success. No bypass identified. 33100 addresses misleading resume availability across linked decisions/roles. Root native0333 final:39 passed.
- Accounting own-envelope lifecycle advertised native execution although command permitted Owner/Admin/Buyer/operations only. 30060 now narrows projection/RFQ access to actual native ACL; no broader accounting grant. Source rechecked; worker0339 TAP8/8, zero not-ok/errors.

- Quote comparison35000/adaptor: immutable raw PostgreSQL JSON numbers above2^53 were being rounded before Client parsing. New exact-text transport wraps canonical compare writer and SECURITY INVOKER snapshot read. It keeps RLS and canonical private writer guards, revokes private base, converts only returned copies, leaves raw snapshot/inputhash/cache facts unchanged. No permission/hash regression identified in inspected source/0342 fixture. Worker frozenfa137f78 native0342 raw log read:30/30, complete TAP plan, zero not-ok/errors. Includes actual select_quote_and_notify after exact-text comparison response to preserve hash-based admission. Reviewer did not execute it.

## Test-result attribution

Read existing summary files, did not execute them:

- `/tmp/client-followup-sql.log`:0329=16 PASS;0330=24 PASS; original0332=106 PASS. The combined run also contains an older R6 failure, so its aggregate is **not** a passing complete run.
- `/tmp/client-r6-v2-native.log`:0334=32 PASS; evidence `work/isolated-replay/ec4b51ab-5dc6-4a3d-8638-a83a900f2db9/targeted-fixtures/059038d6-61db-4f71-bc87-5a632ac12262`.
- `/tmp/client-approval-availability-native.log`:0333=39 PASS; evidence suffix `80aa410c-1a45-4809-b5f1-1473cd1f7935` under same isolated replay.
- `/tmp/client-review-remediation-unit-final.log`:3 files,62 tests PASS.
- Upgrade worker reported native full-cycle/prorata/annual and governance tests plus21 unit tests passing. This review inspected the source, not their complete runtime outputs.
- Legacy tests refused for trigger-bypass syntax were not run by reviewer and are not treated as passes.

Reviewer read final0340 raw log:24 ok,1..24 complete plan, zero not-ok and ERROR/FATAL lines. Worker also reports original0332=106 and0247/0248=73/37 after30070. These are worker-executed runs, not reviewer runs. Already-posted wrong allocations require a separate governed correction; the additive migration does not rewrite immutable accounting history. Long lot-history performance was not benchmarked by this source review.

The R1–R8 source remediation review is complete with no further concrete blocker identified in the inspected paths. Root's fresh integrated replay and remaining browser/provider recipe remain necessary. R9/R10 source remediation and implementation-worker native evidence were subsequently reviewed below. No further concrete blocker was identified in these inspected paths; this remains a scoped review, not a general security certification.

Read worker raw logs `/tmp/client-boxes-0341_quota_audit_lock_and_chain_order.test.sql.log` and `/tmp/client-boxes-0008_p03_audit_outbox.test.sql.log`: respectively14/14 and17/17, complete plans, zero not-ok/ERROR/FATAL. Read deterministic harness source and final JSON summary: two real PostgreSQL sessions, synthetic SQL actor, network-none container, zero retries; quota one accepted/one54000 refusal and exactly one active site; delayed preallocated identity then later audit seal yields one linear canonical chain. The summary explicitly sets `nativeGoTrueCertified:false`; this review does not reclassify it as a browser-auth certification. Separate browser cohorts are root/browser worker evidence, not independently reviewed here.

## R11 — grouped-purchase mutual RLS recursion

Root/browser reproduction reported native SQLSTATE42P17 while Owner opened grouped purchases, including an empty result filter. Source20260912006600 policies `reservations_scoped_read` and `provider_allocations_scoped_read` expanded one another's inline EXISTS queries. This failed during policy planning, regardless of whether rows existed. The reservation policy also used `allocation.reservation_id=id` with an unqualified `id` binding to the inner allocation rather than the outer reservation, breaking intended Provider linkage.

Additive36000 changes the two policies to private SECURITY DEFINER boolean predicates taking only the canonical reservation/allocation ID. Each predicate checks real current auth.uid and active session, retrieves actual linked rows, then permits only Client-organization membership, assigned Provider membership or the existing central/Auditor read authority. Fixed search_path, explicit row bindings, boolean-only return and authenticated EXECUTE grant preserve policy invocation without exposing row contents. No direct table writes or additional financial authority are granted; sensitive command AAL2 guards remain in place. Consumption policies become nonrecursive transitively. No further concrete blocking finding was identified in this source.

```

Worker evidence read at `work/volume-rls343/`:

- `volume343-before.sql` explicitly expects42P17 for populated owned projection and zero-row filter; `volume343-before.log` contains2/2 expected-error assertions passing.
- `volume343-after.log`:27/27 assertions, complete TAP plan, zero not-ok/ERROR/FATAL lines. Covers exact Client projection, empty filter, Client A/B isolation, two Providers sharing one reservation but denied peer allocation, unassigned Provider, central Finance/Auditor, denied writes, AAL2-sensitive command unchanged and revoked session.
- Actual table reads execute under SET ROLE authenticated; pgTap assertions run as database owner. These are synthetic SQL actor fixtures, not nativeGoTrue browser certification.
- The private schema has no authenticated USAGE, so direct helper foreign-ID boolean tests use owner execution with bound actor claims. The browser cannot directly invoke private schema helpers; production table RLS still invokes the predicates with authenticated EXECUTE permissions.
- Worker aligned disposable-clone table ACLs to source-held SELECT-only grants because the destination image's inherited defaults added CRUD. For legacy0049 compatibility, later aligned the volume tables and three existing RPC ACLs to held read-only source metadata; recorded exact commands in ignored `source-acl-alignment.sql`. Source-held/browser objects were not written. Reviewer read latest0049-compat.log:30/30 and repeated0343-after:27/27, zero not-ok/errors. This is source-ACL fidelity, not a permission expansion in the source migration.

R11 cause is addressed in reviewed frozen source and worker SQL regression. Root's fresh integrated migration/tests and nativeGoTrue grouped-purchase browser follow-up remain required. Root reported a prior full456-migration/30-new-test pass before R11; that evidence must not be described as including36000.


## Final handoff

R1–R11 identified causes are addressed in the frozen source reviewed here. No additional concrete blocking finding remained in these inspected changes at handoff. Integration validation belongs to root: fresh migration replay, final type/lint/build/tests, browser recipe and honest external-access/integration limitations. No merge, production deployment, remote database write, secret inspection or external message was performed by this reviewer.
